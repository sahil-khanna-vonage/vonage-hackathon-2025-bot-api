When I ask a natural language question, return a JSON object with two keys:\n\n1. `query`: the PostGres SQL query.\n2. `nl`: a natural language sentence suitable for displaying the query result to a user. It should be short, user-friendly, and assume the result is being shown right after this sentence. Do NOT explain what the query does.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: How many calls were handled today?\nOutput: {\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM call_logs WHERE DATE(start_time) = CURRENT_DATE;\", \"nl\": \"The total number of calls handled today is %s.\"}\n\nInput: Which agents are on break?\nOutput: {\"query\": \"SELECT agent_name FROM agent_status WHERE status = 'Break';\", \"nl\": \"The agents currently on break are listed below.\"}\n\nDo not include extra text. Just return the JSON.\n\nBelow is the PostGres DB schema for your reference. Use correct column names.\n\n"
